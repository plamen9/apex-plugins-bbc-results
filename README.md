## Description
A Template Component for Oracle APEX (23.1 and above). 
`BBC Results` plugin allows you to display a single game result or a list of results.
`BBC Match Facts` plugin allows you to visualize match facts, such as shots on target, possession, fouls, cards, etc.

## Notes
- `BBC Match Facts` plugin uses the `BBC Results` plugin to display the game teams and result, so make sure to install that one first.
- Games with a `GAME_STATE` value **COMPLETED** will be displayed in **yellow**. **LIVE** ones will be in **blue** and the upcoming fixteres (where `GAME_STATE` is **null**) will be in gray.
- `SHOW_SCORERS` is responsible for displaying or not the goalscorers. 'Y' or 'Yes' will display them, while 'N', 'No' or null values will hide them. You can control it using a hardcoded value, a database column value, `Swtich` item, `Checkbox`, `Dropdown` item, etc.

## Demo Application
[https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/gamma_dev/demo/bbc-results](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/gamma_dev/demo/bbc-results)

## Installation
> *Note: While importing the plugins, select the `-No Theme-` option for `Install Into Theme` question. If you select `42. Universal Theme`, the plugin will be installed into **Shared Components** \ **Templates**, instead of **Plugins** and its' identifier will be changed from `BBC_RESULTS` to `THEME$BBC_RESULTS`. If you still want to use this option, make sure to change the reference to the `BBC_RESULTS` in `BBC_MATCH_FACTS`. This is on line 28 in the `Report Body` section. This should be changed from `{apply BBC_RESULTS/}` to `{apply THEME$BBC_RESULTS/}`.
 
1. Import plugin file `apex-plugins-bbc-results.sql` into your application. 
2. Import plugin file `apex-plugins-bbc-match-facts.sql` into your application.
3. (Optional) Deploy the CSS/JS files from `server` directory on your webserver and change the "File Prefix" to web servers folder (Inside the Plugin Settings).

## Usage
üî∏ As a `Partial (Single)`
- Create a new Region of type `BBC Results`. You can use any type of source for the data. Here is an example of a `SQL Query`:
```sql
select 'CSKA Sofia' home_team,
       3 home_team_score,
       'Plamen Mushkov (15'')|Plamen Mushkov (62'')|Plamen Mushkov (70'')' home_team_scorers,
       'Levski Sofia' away_team,
       0 away_team_score, 
       null away_team_scorers,
       'COMPLETED' game_state,
       'FT' status_label,
       null game_url, 
       :P2_SHOW_SCORERS show_scorers -- 'Y' or 'N'
from dual;
```
- Go to the Region `Attributes` section. From `Appearance` \ `Diisplay` select `Partial (Single)`.
- Map the query columns to the relevant attributes from the list (full list of options and their description - below).

üî∏ As a `Multiple (Report)`
- Create a new Region of type `BBC Results`. You can use any type of source for the data. Here is an example of a `SQL Query`:
```sql
select home_team, home_team_score, home_team_scorers,
       away_team, away_team_score, away_team_scorers,
       game_state, status_label, game_url, show_scorers 
from games
where league = 'Premier League'
  and matchday = 10;
```
> **Sample text for the each column can be found in the previous example.*
- Go to the Region `Attributes` section. From `Appearance` \ `Diisplay` select `Multiple (Report)`.
- Map the query columns to the relevant attributes from the list (full list of options and their description - below).

üî∏ As a column in a `Classic Report`, `Interactive Report` or `Interactive Grid`
- Create a new Region of type `Classic Report`, `Interactive Report` or `Interactive Grid`.  You can use any type of source for the data. Here is an example of a `SQL Query`:
```sql
select home_team, home_team_score, home_team_scorers,
       away_team, away_team_score, away_team_scorers,
       game_state, status_label, game_url, show_scorers,
       null result
from games
where league = 'Premier League'
  and matchday = 10;
```
